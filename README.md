## Introduction
In recent years, deep learning has developed rapidly. More and more researchers
have applied deep learning to different fields, like data analysis, predictions. In
terms of predictions, many neural networks, which are an important part of deep
learning, have been used in predicting stock price. In this project, we will focus
on predicting the revenue of companies. We test and compare the performances
of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and try to
figure out a better neural network for predicting the revenue of companies. The
result indicates that MLP is a better neural network for making predictions on the
revenue of companies in the next quarter.
